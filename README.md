# The Biased Venture Capital System

Women owned businesses are growing 2X faster than all businesses nationwide, and yet, they only receive 2.8% of venture capital (VC) funding. The goal of this project is to help female entrepreneurs understand the VC funding landscape by producing a model to predict success of raising funds while also investigating gender bias and providing recommendations.

As the Project Lead and Data Science Fellow, Teneika led a team to create a model to evaluate the factors the lead to a Women-Owned or Women-Led business moving to the LP or GP stage of a venture deal. The outcome provided recommendations and access to a Tableau tool providing additional insight. 


The team and I placed in top 5 projects out of 200 in the program.<br><br>
