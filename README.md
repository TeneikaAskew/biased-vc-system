As the Project Lead and Data Science Fellow, Teneika led a team to create a model to evaluate the factors the lead to a Women-Owned or Women-Led business moving to the LP or GP stage of a venture deal. The outcome provided recommendations and access to a Tableau tool providing additional insight.

The goal of this project is to help female entrepreneurs understand the VC funding landscape by producing a model to predict success of raising funds while also investigating gender bias and providing recommendations.
