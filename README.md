# biased-vc-system

As the Project Lead and Data Science Fellow, Teneika led a team to create a model to evaluate the factors the lead to a Women-Owned or Women-Led business moving to the LP or GP stage of a venture deal. The outcome provided recommendations and access to a Tableau tool providing additional insight.
